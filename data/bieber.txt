You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

[Ludacris:]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
she woke me up daily, donâ€™t need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
I'm gone
Bigger, the love, the love is
Bigger, the love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in {gotta believe in me}
Believe it like a fairytale {fairytale}
What you got under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't
Ever, ever let you down {no}
I can't see-saw, it's down {oh}
You know why
Cause we ain't on the playground
No more games cause we're
Big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger {I'm bigger}, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and your bigger

Whoa, remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bully's in the school yard
Can take a hug but not kisses from us
We ain't pushovers, no more baby, cause we're
Big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger {I'm bigger}, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and your bigger

Whoa, I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger {hey}
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger {I'm bigger}, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and your bigger

I remember that like yesterday
We were little then
My baby, you whoa oh
Since then all I can remember
Is that love ain't slowed down cause I'm bigger

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and your bigger

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger {hey}
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger {heart breaker}
And all the haters, I swear
They look so small from up here
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and your bigger
[Sean Kingston:]
Eenie meenie miney mo

If she holla (if, if, if she holla) let her go

She's indecisive
She can't decide
She keeps on lookin'
From left to right

Girl, come a bit closer
Look in my eyes
Searchin' is so wrong

You seem like the type
To love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night
To show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone

You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind

Let me show you what your missin'
Paradise
With me you're winning girl
You don't have to roll the dice
Tell me what you're really here for
Them other guys?
I can see right through you

You seem like the type
To love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after the song
So give me the night
To show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone

Can't make up your mind
Please don't waste my time

"Love Me"

My friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love

'Cuz honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leavin'
'Cuz you're my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong

Fool me, Fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, Kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me u love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
Cuz they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love (of love, of love)
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality.
And when you hold my hand
And I understand that it's meant to be.
'cause baby when you're with me...

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (came by and took me to heaven)
'cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

[Chorus:]
Let the music blast
We gonna do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
'cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin', no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor.
Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation
By taking a chance and more, oh no, because...

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (came by and took me to heaven)
'cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

[Chorus]

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven (came by and took me to heaven, girl)
'cause when i stare in your eyes it couldn't be better (I don't want you to go, oh no, so)

Take my hand
Let's just dance
Watch my feet
Follow me
Don't be scared,
Girl I'm here
If you didn't know,
This is love

Let the music blast
We gonna do our dance
Praise the doubters on
They don't matter at all (oh, baby)
'cause this life's too long
And this love's too strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

So don't fear.
Don't you worry about a thing.
I am here, by you (I'll never let you go)

Don't shed a tear.
Whenever you need me,
I'll be here (I'll never let you go)

Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)
Oh no, oh no, oh... (I'll never let you go)
Alright let's go

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

How many "I told you"s and "Start over"s and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed
Just to take them back?
Tell me that how many either "or"s?
But no more if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine, in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [x3]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back?
Tell me that you couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

(Oh oh) Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, (you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)

(No no) Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you

(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (ya)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall (free to fall)
She's free to fall (fall in love)
With me

Her heart's locked and know what I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl [x3]
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl (yeah yea) [x2]
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first
(I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth
That's what I'm gonna do
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Only you shawty (haha)
[Jessica Jarrell:]
It feels like we've been out at sea,
Oh, so back and forth that's how it seems,
And when I wanna talk you say to me,
That if it's meant to be it will be.

Whoa-oh-oh

So crazy is this thing we call love,
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you,
Get me out here in the water and I,

[Justin Bieber:]
I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's too much
Feel like I'm drowning without your love,
So throw yourself out to me my lifesaver.
Life saver, oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver, oh life saver
Whoa.

Never understood you when you'd say,
Oh, wanted me to meet you halfway,
Oh, felt like I was doing my part,
You kept thinking you were coming up short
It's funny how things change cause now I see.

Ohh, so crazy is this thing we call love,
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you,
Got me out here in the water and I,
I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up
I can't swim on my own
It's too much
Feel like I'm drowning without your love,
So throw yourself out to me my lifesaver.

Oh, t's supposed to be some give and take I know,
But you're only taking and not giving anymore,
So what will I do?
Cause I still love you (still love you baby),
And you're the only one who can save me.

I'm overboard
And I need your love to pull me up (pull me up)
I can't swim on my own
It's too much
Feel like I'm drowning without your love,
So throw yourself out to me my lifesaver.
You see my baby over here, 
Hit the road,
Where she's going that's what nobody knows,
I need to find her before another man does,
I wouldn't want him to steal my love,

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool.
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find,
The sweet love of mine.
I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.

See my baby really needs some help,
Cause she can never stay at home by herself,
She says she needs a little company,
Even if she's not always with me, yeah.

I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool.
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find,
The sweet love of mine.
I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.

Why can't I find you love of mine,
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind,
How did I let you get away? (Yeah, yeah)

I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.

I'm running out of time,
Where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high,
Know that I'm not giving up,
I'd give it all up for her,
But it'll never be enough,
I won't stop until I find,
My runaway love.
For you I'd write a symphony,
I'd tell the violin,
It's time to sink or swim,
Watch them play for ya,
For you I'd be, (whoa oh)
Running a thousand miles,
Just to get to where you are.

Step to the beat of my heart,
I don't need a whole lot,
But for you I admit I,
I'd rather give you the world,
Or we can share mine,
I know I won't be the first one,
giving you all this attention,
Baby listen,
I just need somebody to love,
I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody, I need somebody,
I need somebody, I need somebody

Every day,
I bring the sun around,
I sweep away the clouds,
Smile for me.
I would take,
Every second, every single time,
Spend it like my last dime.

Step to the beat of my heart,
I don't need a whole lot,
But for you I admit I,
I'd rather give you the world,
Or we can share mine,
I know I won't be the first one,
Givin' you all this attention,
Baby listen,
I just need somebody to love,
I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,
I just need somebody to love.
I need somebody, I need somebody,

Somebody to love.
I need somebody, I need somebody,
I need somebody, I need somebody
I just need somebody to love.

And you can have it all,
Anything you want,
I can bring; give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want,
I can't find cause,
Money can't find me,
Somebody to love (oh, oh)
Find me somebody to love (whoah ohh)

I need somebody to love,
I don't need too much, just somebody to love,
Somebody to love.
I don't need nothing else,
I promise girl I swear,

I need somebody to love.
To love, to love.
Is she out there? [x3]
I just need somebody to love.

(With you, with you
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place.)

Now Romeo and Juliet,
Bet they never felt the way we felt.
Bonnie and Clyde,
Never had to hide like we do, we do.
You and I both know it can't work,
It's all fun and games,
'til someone gets hurt,
And I know I wont let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
Cause I know you cant love me, hey
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can't do,
To fight with time and space,
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sonny and Cher,
I don't care I've got you baby.
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber,
Cause either way its gonna end right but,
We are both too foolish to stop.

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
And I know you can't love me, hey
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can't do,
To fight with time and space,
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be,
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscing about these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go
And I still let go,
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
(Yeaaah oh no no no)

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can't do,
To fight with time and space,
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Oh
Yeah
Mmmm

I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world
Yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get
Any less than you should
Cause baby
You smile I smile (oh)
Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey

Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say (hey)
If you need me
I'll come runnin'
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile (oh whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey

Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
Cause baby (hey)
You smile, I smile (whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
Make me smile baby

Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command
Hey hey hey

You smile, I smile (whoa)
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
Oh

You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl
And I'm not ready to call it quits

We make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby believe me

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

It's a big big world
And I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls
From every ocean
That we're swimmin' in

We make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby believe me, ooh

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Baby we were underground
We're on the surface now
We're gonna make it girl
I promise
If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but

We can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We're taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strenght of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Yeah
Nowhere but up

[Usher:]
(It's your chance, take her hand to the floor)
Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)
Ladies, I know you're ready
(Cuz you only got one chance for your first dance)
Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance
(So take advantage of the slow jam)
Tell 'em JB

[Justin:]
When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams

[Chorus:]
Only if you give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)
Here's the opportunity

[Chorus:]
Only if you give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
That's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give your first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly
If you give (give), give the first dance to me (give the first dance, baby)
I'm gon' cherish every moment (oh, oh, oh)
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Usher:]
It's your chance, take her hand
To the floor, to the floor
Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance
Your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah, man

[Justin:]
If you give (give it), give the first dance to me (give it)
I'm gon' cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
